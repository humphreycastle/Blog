## Introduction

Barack Obama had said, “Do not shortchange the future because of fear in the present.” However, some situations seem to be changing in the last few years. Since the 2016 United States presidential election had ended, the decisions made by the White House have always been controversial. Especially in foreign policy, the conservative and populist tendency has become increasingly evident; for those countries who challenge the United States’ benefits and advantages in the international, the White House mostly shows overreacting to carries some extreme strategies.

The foreign policy needs to be changed. Syria issues come to the first to bear the brunt. The United States is supposed not to withdraw from participating in Syria due to its serious relation to the political and economic interests of the US in the Middle East and the competition with Russia, and the process of promoting the universal value of democratic freedom worldwide. In East Asia, the same problem has just begun to emerge recently. People have speculated that the result of the Hong Kong issue will herald the final countermeasure of China to Taiwan in the future. The ending scene of the Taiwan issue is likely to come ahead of arrival; thus, the United States must come up with efficient and targeted solutions rather than capriciously carrying out tariff increases. Mentioning tariffs, it should be emphasized that continuing the trade war is clearly the most stupid double-lose decision. Domestic consumers in the United States are about to start taking on several times the pressure of consumption in the past, completely contrary to Donald Trump’s willingness to formulate policies at first.
