Regarding spirit possession as roleplaying i.e., the possessed is playing the role of the spirit, is a modern mistake. The modernity—the belief in science—does tend to deny the meanings of spirit and trance, which play an important role in spirit possession yet do not exist in roleplaying. Based on the understanding of the difference between spirit possession and roleplaying, I think, they enable one’s self to cope with oppression in their own ways. With the examination of the haouka ceremony in the 1950s in Ghana, the zar ceremony in the 1970s in Sudan, and the drag ball in the 1980s in the US, the essay is about how spirit possession and roleplaying enable one’s self to cope with oppression.

## Those Who Under Oppression

In the Hofriyati world—the site of the zar ceremony—the male-over-female gender relations cause oppression on women: a Hofriyati woman is subordinate to her husband and brother(s) (Boddy 2008:372). Meanwhile, the linkages between fertility and femininity i.e., the responsibility of reproduction is mostly on women (Boddy 2008:371), and the linkages between fertility and morality i.e., pharaonic circumcision invests women with morality and thus enables them to reproduce(Boddy 2008:370), also lead to pressure on the Hofriyati women.

Just in the past October and November, the situation in Syria has undergone several critical transitions. The United States withdrew its troops, Turkey suddenly attacked the Kurdish armed forces, Russia conducted mediation, and the United States resumed its support for the Kurdish armed forces. According to the situation in Syria in the past two years, the Kurdish armed forces occupied in the northeast and parts of the northwestern territories have undoubtedly become one of the most influencing factors affecting the peace of Syria.

This is also why the US Congress decided to re-engage with the Kurdish forces in the past few days. After Trump issued his immature order, he and his advisors were obviously shocked by the sudden insertion of Turkey. However, as a reason for withdrawing troops at that time: wasting a large amount of unnecessary military investment, it seems that it has no convincement. Because maintaining military control in Syria is neither unnecessary nor costing largely.
